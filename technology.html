                    <h3>Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive</h3>
                    <p>Subaru's Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive system is the cornerstone of our engineering philosophy. Unlike part-time or front-wheel-drive-based systems, our symmetrical layout features a longitudinally mounted Boxer engine that delivers power equally to all four wheels.</p>
                    <p>This unique configuration provides superior balance, stability, and traction in all weather conditions. The symmetrical design minimizes power loss and weight transfer, resulting in predictable handling and enhanced safety whether you're navigating city streets or mountain roads.</p>
                    <p>Every Subaru vehicle (except the BRZ) comes standard with Symmetrical AWD, making it one of the most accessible all-wheel-drive systems in the automotive industry.</p>

                    <h3>EyeSight® Driver Assist Technology</h3>
                    <p>Subaru EyeSight is one of the most comprehensive driver assist systems available. Using dual color cameras mounted near the rearview mirror, EyeSight monitors traffic movement, optimizes cruise control, and warns drivers of potential dangers.</p>
                    <p>The system includes Adaptive Cruise Control that maintains a set distance from the vehicle ahead, Pre-Collision Braking that can apply full braking force to avoid or mitigate frontal collisions, Lane Keep Assist and Sway Warning, and Pre-Collision Throttle Management.</p>
                    <p>Independent testing by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) has shown that EyeSight can reduce rear-end crashes with injuries by up to 85%, making it one of the most effective safety systems on the market.</p>

                    <h3>Boxer Engine Technology</h3>
                    <p>The Subaru Boxer engine, with its horizontally opposed pistons, is a masterpiece of automotive engineering. Unlike traditional inline or V-type engines, the Boxer's pistons move horizontally in opposite directions, creating perfect primary balance.</p>
                    <p>This unique configuration results in a lower center of gravity, reduced vibration, and improved vehicle stability. The compact design allows for better crash safety as the engine can slide under the passenger compartment during frontal impacts.</p>
                    <p>Modern Subaru Boxer engines feature direct injection, turbocharging in performance models, and advanced emissions controls. The latest generation includes innovations like cylinder deactivation for improved fuel efficiency and a thermal management system for optimal operating temperature.</p>

                    <h3>Subaru Global Platform</h3>
                    <p>The Subaru Global Platform represents a fundamental evolution in vehicle architecture. This revolutionary platform enhances safety, comfort, and driving dynamics while providing flexibility for future technologies including electrification.</p>
                    <p>Key benefits include 70-100% greater rigidity compared to previous platforms, significantly improved impact absorption in collisions, reduced vibration and noise for a quieter cabin, and enhanced steering response for a more engaging driving experience.</p>
                    <p>The platform is designed to accommodate hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and fully electric powertrains, demonstrating Subaru's commitment to sustainable mobility. Its modular design allows for efficient production of multiple vehicle types while maintaining exceptional quality and consistency.</p>

                    <h3>X-MODE with Hill Descent Control</h3>
                    <p>Subaru's X-MODE is an advanced traction management system designed for challenging driving conditions. When activated, it optimizes engine output, transmission ratios, and braking distribution to maintain control on slippery surfaces.</p>
                    <p>The system includes Hill Descent Control, which automatically maintains a low, steady speed when descending steep grades, allowing the driver to focus solely on steering. X-MODE also features deep snow/mud mode for extreme conditions and automatic grade braking.</p>
                    <p>This technology makes Subaru vehicles exceptionally capable in off-road situations while remaining completely accessible to everyday drivers. It's the perfect example of how Subaru translates rally-proven technology into practical, real-world benefits.</p>
